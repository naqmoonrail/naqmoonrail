# 👋 Hello

I recruit insanely talented, hardworking, out of the box thinking individuals to work at CSGOEmpire and at our soon to launch crypto casino, Duel. There’s plenty of room for growth, experimentation, and leadership for those that fit our ethos and can bring our vision to life. Experience in the CSGO or crypto/web3 spaces is especially appreciated!

# 🎲 About CSGOEmpire

Empire exists as the antidote to scammers within the casino industry. Our industry is highly profitable, which naturally attracts shady characters of various kinds, making the space rife with lying and cheating, often in deeply sophisticated ways. But we believe that given enough years, a model based on excellence, simplicity, and transparency will surpass any grift, scam, or short-term money grab that the CSGO skin gambling scene is so familiar with. 

Both in terms of ethics and money, operating honestly is the +EV play!

# 💼 How We Hire 
We have a skill-based recruitment process because we want to hire the best people. So University degrees aren’t a requirement for any role, and we have no such thing as a diversity quota.

After submitting an initial application, here’s the usual process for shortlisted candidates:
1. Let your skills shine in a technical assessment (we use CodeAid to assess Vue or Laravel skills, depending on the role)
2. Chat with 2 of our devs in a 45 min. chat
3. Meet our CTO for a final 20 min. chat
